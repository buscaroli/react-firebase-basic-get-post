# React-Firebase-basic-post-get

## _This is just an exercise done in a rush!_

I wanted to check how to use the Firebase service and decided to create an app that can send and receive messages.

After that I decided to try to implement authentication.

At the moment users can signup, login, post a message, delete a message and check the list of their messages.

### TO BE CONTINUED (if having enough time)...

- Implement user update and delete
- Implement message update ~~and delete~~
- I could swap messages for something else
- Use Firebase's orderBy() function instead of your own pre-render sorting
